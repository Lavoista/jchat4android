= Customizing jChat =



After getting the sources, jChat can be easily customized in different ways. 

== Adding new tracks for mocked GPS location provider ==
To add new tracks you should follow these steps:
 # Launch Google Earth
 # In the _Search_ tool, select the _Directions_ tab and specify the endpoints for your track
 # Right click on the _Route_ icon
 # Choose _Save place as_ and then _kml_ as file format
 # Rename your file to simply "kml" (no extension)
 # Launch Android emulator
 # Run a shell on the emulator with {{{adb shell}}} 
 # Go to {{{/data/misc/location}}} and create a directory that shall have the same name of the Android location provider. You can choose whatever name you want (let's say "mygps"). To do so issue the command: {{{mkdir /data/misc/location/mygps}}}
 # Exit from the adb shell
 # Copy the kml file to the emulator issuing the command: {{{adb push <PATH_TO_KML> /data/misc/location/mygps}}}
 # Copy the location and properties files (that you can find in jchat sources under {{{cfg/locations}}} folder or under the {{{/data/misc/location/gps}}} folder on the emulator) in  {{{/data/misc/location/mygps}}}
 # Restart the Android emulator
 # Check the file strings.xml that you can find in {{{<JCHAT_ROOT>\res\values}}}. In particular you have to set the value of the {{{location_provider_name}}} variable like that {{{<string name="location_provider_name">mygps </string>}}}
 # Rebuild the jChat apk file with the new data
 # Install the  jChat.apk file on the emulator (with Eclipse or through {{{adb install}}})
 # Launch jChat on the emulator
